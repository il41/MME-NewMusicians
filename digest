## Digest 1
#### February 14 2018

In the summer of 2017, "fake artists on Spotify" becomes a mini-scandal.
The company denied any use of "fake" artists, but there where many artists who get lots of plays on ambient and piano type playlists and who seemed to have no social media presence.
Initially I assumed AI were creating the music, but MBW researched and found that a Swedish music production firm were in some way responsible.
However, this paves the way for anonymous artists (like AI) to make music for highly played background playlists, which would let Spotify not pay royalties for real composer's "background piano chillout music."
MBW then found out that François Pachet, an expert in AI and music, was hired by Spotify, suggesting a future of AI music directly tied with the streaming giant.

Article on Facebook's algorithms that argues that algorithms "erode free will." :https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/19/facebooks-war-on-free-will
"The problem is that when we outsource thinking to machines, we are really outsourcing thinking to the organisations that run the machines."
"Or if we want to be melodramatic about it, we could say Facebook is constantly tinkering with how its users view the world – always tinkering with the quality of news and opinion that it allows to break through the din, adjusting the quality of political and cultural discourse in order to hold the attention of users for a few more beats."

Who's designing the tech and how do their goals influence the tech?
François, with SONY and Spotify, seems to be a commercial player.
The future looks grim as corporate agents are heading AI development, and will likely lobby and gain control over proprietary AI industry.
I would like to get deeper into processing in order to start following tutorials by Siraj Raval on machine learning.
Learned some intro to python via "Python the Hard Way."

Amay showed me his OpenFrameworks projects in machine learning. Really interesting interactions and tools!
He showed me his project to intro to Wekinator on github.
Wekinator was created as a machine learning creation tool for artists.
I begin to learn open frameworks via youtube OpenFrameworks. User Lewis Lepton's tutorials.
I find out that openFrameworks runs on Xcode, not just by itself.
I can draw images! I suppose it reminds me of arduino because of and arduino are both c/c++ based?
