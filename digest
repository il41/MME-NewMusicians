In the summer of 2017, "fake artists on Spotify" becomes a mini-scandal.
The company denied any use of "fake" artists, but there where many artists who get lots of plays on ambient and piano type playlists and who seemed to have no social media presence.
Initially I assumed AI were creating the music, but MBW researched and found that a Swedish music production firm were in some way responsible.
However, this paves the way for anonymous artists (like AI) to make music for highly played background playlists, which would let Spotify not pay royalties for real composer's "background piano chillout music."
MBW then found out that Fran√ßois Pachet, an expert in AI and music, was hired by Spotify, suggesting a future of AI music directly tied with the streaming giant.
